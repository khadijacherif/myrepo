 AI & Public Policy
When it comes to artificial intelligence and public policy, the overlap is going to be, or has already become inevitable. The integration of such a powerful technology must be considered as a key pillar towards our futures as global citizens. It is, therefore, a critical matter that needs to be urgently addressed by public officials. “AI systems are enabling humans to successfully confront an ever-widening range of societal challenges (The Alan Turing Institute, 2020).” If used properly, AI can assist in solving critical matters that humans deal with on a daily basis - from business operations to medical solutions - the possibilities are endless. Governments and authorities that set the shift of AI to become a core integration in the various sectors that make up a nation can be a key determinant in how progressive and well-developed a nation state can become.

That being said, AI systems are not flawless, and they do possess undeniable limitations, some of which are unknown to humankind. This is why implementations of AI systems must be monitored meticulously. We must carefully observe its performance in real life in order to better understand what kinds of risks it can bring about. The shift of AI in public policy is ,in itself, a blackbox and is clouded by uncertainty. This is why I believe it is important to enter a long phase of testing, to experiment with AI systems and observe their implications in a controlled environment. This would give us a better idea on how to handle its integration and to figure out what other possible risks can come to life from it, that we have not yet considered. I think the idea of failing safely and iterating experimentations rapidly could be a possible solution to better introduce the shift of AI systems into society.

Another important factor to facilitate the transition of AI in public policy is to simply bring the technology closer to humans. The element that must be highly considered is the ability to translate human action into algorithms, only without the flaws, or biases that are naturally ingrained in us as humans. 

This brings me to my next point… which brave collective group of people are we going to hold accountable who are we going to hold accountable for fostering AI systems into our lives? And specifically, how do we want to hold them accountable? It is critical for us to set the necessary boundaries that limit the possible damages that we could face as a negative consequence of the power that is AI. Regulating this accountability is also going to be a challenge, but will bring order and structure towards the proper integrations of AI systems in society.

AI & Ethics
It goes without saying that the topic of ethics goes hand in hand with the topic of Artificial Intelligence. It would be negligent to bring about AI without considering what are the ethical concerns that we should be addressing when considering the integration of this technological progress that continues to grow more and more rapidly. 

The most prominent concerns we face include the following:
How does AI impact our rights to privacy as global citizens?
Could AI be a technological replica of the existence of human bias?
Does AI pose a threat towards employment?

I believe there’s a yes and no answer to each of these questions. But the way these questions are being asked is more flawed than the technology itself. What we should be concerned about is how to limit AI from becoming invasive to our daily lives, how can we address the limitations of human input, when developing AI systems and most importantly, how can we better prepare the workforce with the suitable skills to embrace the 4th industrial revolution for its benefits rather than deteriorate it because of its threats. 

I believe that the ethical concerns that come about these technologies can be addressed through great leadership, and nothing less. But of course, this leadership comes from years of expertise within the domain, in collaboration with high awareness and consciousness of the existing societal structures - i.e. how do we create a seamless integration of AI for it to meet its essential purpose of improving our daily lives as humans. 

But of course, this is much simpler in theory than it is in practice. We are facing rapid developments of AI-empowered technologies. But could we be developing their integrations too quickly? We see the damages that AI has caused with the unfortunate deathly accident that included Uber’s driverless vehicle. But this situation is subjective to who we see as being at fault. However, it is issues such as this that continue to further our discussion regarding the ethical questions that come to life.

This leads me to think about the blackbox matter when it comes to deep learning which continues to raise even more questions regarding just how ethical is AI? In present times, I believe these questions should continue to be raised, and we should continue to challenge the integration of AI systems, even if it does get redundant at times. The power that AI holds is vast and applicable to a variety of endless contexts and possibilities, so the questions are most likely never going to end. However, I believe that its incremental integrations will provide us with some critical learning environments to better understand how to confront the technology and how to ultimately limit it in some aspects and some features in order for it not to prevent its misuse in real life.
